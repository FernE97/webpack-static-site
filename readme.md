## Webpack - Static Site Builder

Basically a stripped down version of [Static Site Boilerplate](https://github.com/ericalli/static-site-boilerplate) with
some minor updates and changes.

```zsh
# run webpack-dev-server
yarn start

# build to dist folder
yarn build:dist

# linters
yarn lint:js
yarn lint:styles

# deploy
yarn deploy
```
